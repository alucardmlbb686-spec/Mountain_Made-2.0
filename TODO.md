# TODO - Admin Functions Fix & Image Upload

## Completed:
- [x] Plan created and confirmed

## In Progress:
- [x] Add multer middleware to server.js (reject SVG, accept JPG/PNG)
- [x] Add upload route for handling image uploads

## Pending:
- [ ] Update admin.html with real API calls
- [ ] Implement loader functions for all admin sections
- [ ] Add image upload functionality to product form
- [ ] Add client-side file validation (JPG/PNG only)

## Notes:
- Need to implement proper API calls in admin.html
- Multer should reject SVG files and only accept JPG/PNG
- All admin functions (dashboard, products, orders, customers, etc.) need to fetch data from API
